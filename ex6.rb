# variable initialized for maximum hilarity
types_of_people = 10
# set variable x to string value with previously initialized variable appended.
x = "There are #{types_of_people} types of people."
# Set two variables to strings
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
# Combine two variable strings inline with initialization of third variable.
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."

# Print string varaibales to screen with newline.
puts x
puts y

# Print string to screen with variables added inline.
puts "I said: #{x}."
puts "I also said: '#{y}'."

# Set variable to boolean value.

# set variable x to string value with previously initialized variable appended.
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! #{hilarious}"

# Print resulting appended string.
puts joke_evaluation

# Set two variables to strings with identifiable and descriptive traits
w = 'This is the left side of...'
